Information is, in fact, the stuff that feeds decision-making — whether
 it be strategic or mundanely operational (

 Certainly, decision-making can be a strategic activity (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Leiblein2018"

 Recently, high degrees of concentration of information under the control
 of a small number of large technology firms have led to commensurate concentrat
ions of marketplace power (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The development of methods to attribute economic value to information are
 correspondingly emerging topics of interest for both research and regulation

We undertake here the ambitious task of formulating a generalized framework
 for characterizing competitive differentiation based on information.
 The discipline of Information Economics provides our foundation (

\end_inset

).
 This field is exactly focused on informational-value attribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information Economics finds its most-common applications in financial markets.
 It provides theories and operating concepts for markets and their equilibria.
 Its principles also influence quantitative — or algorithmic — trading (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This study proceeds as follows.
 We first introduce the relevant principles from Information Economics.
 We make the case for their employment as bases for understanding information-ba
sed competitive differentiation.
 We treat these basic principles as axioms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From these axioms, three distinct modes of information-based differentiation
 emerge.
 We further explore each mode in turn.
 We first revisit how our information-economic axioms appear for a given
 mode of differentiation mode.
 We then examine exemplary operating models conforming to that mode.
 We finally consider the defensibility of advantages based on each mode.

We conclude with an outline in broad strokes of a framework for thinking

\begin_layout Section*
The Information Economics of Competitive Differentiation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information Economics seeks to systematically attribute economic value to
 information.
 The field resides at the nexus of three other disciplines.
 We synopsize them here and motivate their generalization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, Information Theory characterizes uncertainty and information.
 It spans two branches.
 Its probability-and-statistics view came from the telecommunications industry
 (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Shannon1948,Gallagher1968"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Borrowing from the field of statistical thermodynamics (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Ben-Naim2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), it quantifies states of knowledge on a continuum from complete ignorance
 to perfect certainty.
 Information and uncertainty turn out to be different sides of the same
 coin (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Briggs2016"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Semantic (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Zhong2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) and syntactic (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Chomsky2014"
literal "false"

\end_inset

) branches of information theory combine into a complementary view.
 These disciplines delve into the realm of human cognition.
 Less mathematically-tractable, they nonetheless provide practical frameworks
 for charactering the state of knowledge on which decisions are based.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Game theory provides the second leg of the Information-Economics tripod.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Birchler1999"

\end_inset

 specifically focus on 
\shape italic
the elementary game
\shape default
.
 Its use serves to explain how market equilibria occur even in the presence
 of information asymmetries (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Brunnermeier2001"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, microeconomic principles bring in the utility perspective.
 Marketplace transactions effect exchanges in utility between counter-parties.
 Desirable transactions are win-win, resulting in net-positive changes to
 counter-parties' collective utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information-Economics concepts are typically applied to explaining the operation
s of transactional markets.
 They explain how, for example, bid and ask prices during negotiation disclose
 counter-parties' proprietary positions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extending Information Economics principles beyond their transactional context
 comprises our present ambition.
 How do we propose to accomplish this? We shift our focus from information's
 role as a transactional asset to that of a strategic asset along the lines
 suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drucker1992"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We want moreover to look beyond the focus in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Drucker1999"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 on operational efficiency.
 Our strategic-impact characterization follows from the utility derived
 from acting on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Information in a strategic context supports decision-making about marketplace
 positioning, organizational design, and operational alignment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Leiblein2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The value of strategic information can therefore be quantified in terms
 influencing corporate financials, such as balance-sheet assets and realized
 revenue on income statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The role advocated here for information's contribution to differentiation
 is not altogether unprecedented.

 and technical competencies of handling data, to shaping the informational

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What then does Information Economics have to contribute to this established
 body of work? We seek — through laying a more-formal undergirding derived
 from economic theory — to provide opportunities for more-systematic characteriz
ation and management of the complexities underlying competitive differentiation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decision Analysis represents the most-immediate beneficiary to which a theory
 of information-based differentiation might innovatively contribute.
 Thereafter, operational and organizational modeling may also benefit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Information-Economics Concepts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Birchler and Bütler present a view of information that is in a narrow sense
 strategic (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

).
 They distinguish between 
\shape italic
strategic
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
non-strategic
\shape default
 players.
 Given information, strategic players seek to maximize their utility.
 Non-strategic players play blindly.
 In financial economics, some employ this criterion to distinguish between
 investors and gamblers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This leads to our 
\shape italic
essential axiom
\shape default
 from Information Economics: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The value of information is the increase in utility an expects from receiving

.
 We then have two components to our valuation framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Informational Component of Information Valuation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first have the information itself.
 We must attribute a degree of confidence to the information.
 We consider it in terms of the extent to which it supports — or not — an
 assertion about a specific state of nature.
 We are only certain of such states on the rarest of occasions.
 Some degree of doubt nearly always burdens us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 1998 motion picture 
\shape italic
The Red Violin
\shape default
 illustrates through an example resembling one used by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "pp. 5-6"
key "Shafer1976"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The main character — an appraiser of rare musical instruments — is hired
 to inspect a lot to be auctioned off by a world-renowned auction house.
 The lot contains a specimen he suspects might be the lost masterpiece from
 an Italian master craftsman.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our hero begins collecting evidence to establish the instrument's authenticity.
 A lab technician measures acoustic spectra.
 A world-famous virtuoso plays it, then coyly displays ambivalence.
 Minuscule samples of paint and wood are sent for laboratory analysis and
 dating.
 instrument's interior is inspected — using an electro-optical device —
 to discover what appears to be the master craftsman's signature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each piece of evidence in isolation supports to varying degrees our appraiser's
 belief in the instrument's authenticity.
 When the main character assembles them all, he acquires a degree of confidence
 on which to take a substantial risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The Utility-Realization Component of Information Valuation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acting on our information produces some payoff.
 This arises from our decision to act — or not — given the degree of confidence
 we have in our evidentiary corpus, to borrow a term from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Smets1994"

\end_inset

.
 This is driven by another fundamental principle, the 
\shape italic
von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 describes 
\shape italic
Epistemic Utility Theory
\shape default
, a closely-related principle (pp.
 1-9).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These guidelines basically tell us to optimize our 
\shape italic
expected
\shape default
 utility.
 What the best outcome is, utility-wise, is based on our organization's
 policies, priorities, appetite for risk, competencies, and other considerations.
 It provides a coherent framework keeping straight the things that matter
 to us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, in our utility-maximization principle, 
\shape italic
expected
\shape default
 becomes the operative word.
 Our outcomes are very-rarely certain.
 We have two sources of variability that may cause actual outcomes to differ
 from expectations.
 First, we have some residual uncertainty in our information.
 We do not assert with complete certainty that our evidence unequivocally
 supports exactly the state of nature our actions assume.
 This ambiguity weights on what our exceptions are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Secondly, there may be variability in the affects from actions we take maximize
 our utility.
 We might be outbid in trying to acquire a piece of real estate.
 Or our action might be to launch a capital investment in an IT project.
 Such concerns can be notoriously fraught (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Flyvbjerg2011"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 Seizing — in terms of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Teece2009"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 — may require us to exercise previously-undemonstrated organizational competenc
ies.
 These may in turn lead to hedging, which further complicates our utility
 calculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Modes of Information Differentiation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mathematical mechanisms of 
\shape italic
Dempster-Shafer Theory
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
von Neumann-Morgenstern Axioms
\shape default
 plug very cleanly into each other to give us a formal framework for information
-based differentiation.
 From this we get a rigorous set of tools with which to formally parse our
 present circumstances first described by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Porter1985"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, how we acquire and evaluate evidence touches on Teece's Sensing
 dynamic capability and Reeve's Sensing advantage.
 The efficacy of our actions in response to our evidence touches on Teece's
 Seizing dynamic capability.
 It also underlies the Organization and Systems advantages from Reeves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integrating these together scientifically occurs through modeling.
 Tools from Decision Analysis guide us in understanding the strength of
 our evidence.
 They in turn bridge into organizational and operational models to formulate
 beliefs about the efficacy of intended actions.
 Our Information-Economics framework — coupling Dempster-Shafer with von
 Neumann-Morgenstern — provides the mechanisms for integration.
 Treating these principles as axioms leads us to identify three distinct
 modes of information-based differentiation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Getting Evidence that Others Lack.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We refer to this as 
\shape italic
Differentiated Access
\shape default
.
 We enjoy no information advantage from acting on the same body of evidence
 as our competitors.
 We may decide to act differently from them, based on policies, risk appetitive,
 and other considerations.
 But given the same evidentiary base, we should arrive at the same conclusions
 as our competitors about the state of affairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disciplines of Business Analytics and insights-extraction-style Artificial

 describe a very fundamental mathematical result telling us that we can
 only do so well with a given data set (pp.
 32-33).
 No amount of clever processing will reduce our residual uncertainty about
 any question beyond limits of the data, given their essential characteristics.

 Operating on the same information base as our competitors should not usually
 give us any advantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Things are different when information asymmetries arise.
 Our 
\shape italic
Red Violin
\shape default
 story offers illustrations.
 Our appraiser was not at first completely forthright with his auction-house
 clients.
 He did not apprise them of all of his evidence-gathering activities, or
 even of his suspicion about the provenance of the violin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At one point in the story, the superstar virtuoso's reaction was the only
 evidence that the auction-house managers had.
 That information on the surface might tend to refute any suspicions that
 the instrument was anything special.
 Evidence attesting to its authenticity was however piling up on the desk
 of our appraiser.
 He temporarily enjoyed a considerable information advantage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the auction-house managers however started double-checking on the appraiser
's expenses, they recognized the full extent of his evidentiary collection.
 All the cards were then laid out on the table.
 The information advantage vanished.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*

We refer to this as

.
 Nuance distinguishes this from the previous mode.
 All concerned parties have access to the same body of evidence.
 For the technical reasons described above, any conventional data analytics
 should produce the same results, assuming parity in analytical competencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One concerned party however reads the evidence differently.
 This might be due to freedom from biases or preconceptions.
 Or, it might arise from an advantage in skills of imagination.
 These lead one to interpret the evidence differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our 
\shape italic
Red Violin
\shape default
 illustration, suppose that the auction-house manager knew the superstar
 virtuoso well.
 Perhaps she had dealt with him previously, and knew that he didn't always
 deal forthrightly.
 She might recognize his purported ambivalence about the particular violin
 as disingenuous.
 Her refined musical ear might detect a certain quality to its sound.
 These together might lead her to suspect some unusual and interesting about
 the instrument's provenance.
 Although this evidence was less-strong than that compiled by the appraiser,
 it would not support a conclusion that the violin was

Michael Lewis' novel

 tells the story of the U.S.
 Major League Baseball team Oakland, CA Athletics (As) (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Lewis2004"
literal "false"

\end_inset

).
 The Oakland As successfully competed against teams with much larger player-sala
ry budgets.
 They accomplished this through a player-contribution valuation model that
 was considerably more-insightful than competitors'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate, the 2002 As paid an average salary of slightly less then
 $1.5 million.
 This was substantively less than the industry average of $2.3 million.
 Their novel player-valuation criteria afforded flexibility to consider
 opportunities that competitors overlooked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A novel set of utility criteria was part of the As' approach.
 Winning games was their principal objective.
 This was part of a tradeoff underlying decisions to allow superstar players
 like Jason Giambi go to other teams.
 Such stars produce higher revenues through ticket sales and merchandising.
 Their individual contributions to total games won could however be distributed
 across multiple other judiciously-selected players.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The As' utility metric is illuminating.
 For the 2002 season they won the second-most games in all of major-league
 baseball.
 Their cost per win in terms of player salaries were about $525,000.
 This was one and three-quarters of a standard deviation below the major-league
 average of around $1 million per regular-season win.
 Moreover, their revenue-to-salary ratio was about 1.2 standard deviations
 above the major-league average of 1.54.
 They were third-best of all major-league clubs by the latter metric.
 This differentiated-insights strategy apparently worked well both in terms
 of on-field and business measures of performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These statistics allow us to cursorily illustrate attribution of value to
 player-contribution information for the Oakland As.
 They finished the regular season four games ahead of division runner-up
 Anaheim Angels, which paid $747,000 in player salary per win.
 The Angeles incidentally were the third-most efficient major-league team
 in terms of salary-per-win.
 They ranked behind the As and the Minnesota Twins, who eliminated the former
 in the divisional round of the playoffs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information to identify players needed to achieve the As four-win advantage
 over the Angels could therefore be valued at $2.1 million.
 Given these efficiencies, the Angels might have prevailed at a cost of
 slightly less than $3 million in additional salary expenditures.
 These summaries assume the organizations' costs to acquire players are
 approximately equal and obviously ignore confidence intervals and other
 statistical measures of variation.
 But we do get a sense of the utility-focused reasoning employed in information
 economics.

 in response to a supply-chain disruption.
 This illustrated judicious use of information without explicit reference
 to technology systems by which it is managed and exploited.
 Adaptivity does not necessarily depend on technology.

 They together provide a formal structure for thinking about information-based

\begin_layout Standard
Treating these concepts as axioms leads to three distinct modes of deriving
 advantage from informational asymmetries.
 We can acquire information that others do not have.
 This results primarily through business models deliberately designed to
 produce it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can alternatively achieve information asymmetries through differentiated
 insights.
 This amounts to seeing things — hidden in plain sight — within the evidence
 that others may have missed.
 This might occur due to freedom from biases encumbering others, or from
 a sharper sense of imagination.
 Recognizing opportunities for disruption fits in this category.

Finally, we might exercise a greater ability to take action given a recognized

 In the absence of information asymmetries, the most-capable organization

The formalism of this information-economics approach to differentiation
 offers the potential to address questions of competitiveness more-systematicall

 It provides a mathematical structure to unify different management-science

 The most-immediate benefits accrue to Decision Analysis.
 Subsequently, closer integration with organizational and operational modeling
